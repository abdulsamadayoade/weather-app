# weather-app
This is a simple yet functional weather app I built with vanilla Javascript, HTML & CSS.

The weather info is from OpenWeather API, an external API that provides weather infomation of different cities.

I used Fetch API in getting the data from the API then display them on the webpage. Apart from just getting the data from the API and showing them on the webpage, there is also a search functionality and error 404 page.
